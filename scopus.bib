abstract={Unsupervised co-analysis of a set of shapes is a difficult problem since the geometry of the shapes alone cannot always fully describe the semantics of the shape parts. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning method where the user actively assists in the co-analysis by iteratively providing inputs that progressively constrain the system. We introduce a novel constrained clustering method based on a spring system which embeds elements to better respect their inter-distances in feature space together with the usergiven set of constraints. We also present an active learning method that suggests to the user where his input is likely to be the most effective in refining the results. We show that each single pair of constraints affects many relations across the set. Thus, the method requires only a sparse set of constraints to quickly converge toward a consistent and error-free semantic labeling of the set. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose an active learning technique for solving multiclass problems with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The technique is based on both uncertainty and diversity criteria. The uncertainty criterion is implemented by analyzing the one-dimensional output space of the SVM classifier. A simple histogram thresholding algorithm is used to find out the low density region in the SVM output space to identify the most uncertain samples. Then the diversity criterion exploits the kernel k-means clustering algorithm to select uncorrelated informative samples among the selected uncertain samples. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method we compared it with other batch mode active learning techniques presented in the literature using one toy data set and three real data sets. Experimental results confirmed that the proposed technique provided a very good tradeoff among robustness to biased initial training samples, classification accuracy, computational complexity, and number of new labeled samples necessary to reach the convergence. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper describes improvement of the two-layer SOINN to a single-layer SOINN to represent the topological structure of input data and to separate the generated nodes into different groups and subclusters. We then actively label some teacher nodes and use such teacher nodes to label all unlabeled nodes. The proposed method can learn from both labeled and unlabeled samples. It can query the labels of some important samples rather than selecting the labeled samples randomly. It requires neither prior knowledge, such as the number of nodes, nor the number of classes. It can automatically learn the number of nodes and teacher vectors required for a current task. Moreover, it can realize online incremental learning.

Given an initial document ranking, user interaction with the system produces relevance feedback (RF) which the system then uses to revise the ranking. This interactive process repeats until the user terminates the search. To maximize accuracy relative to user effort, we propose an active learning strategy. At each iteration, the document whose relevance is maximally uncertain to the system is slotted high into the ranking in order to obtain user feedback for it. Simulated feedback on the Robust04 TREC collection shows our active learning approach dominates several standard RF baselines relative to the amount of feedback provided by the user. Evaluation on Robust04 under noisy feedback and on LETOR collections further demonstrate the effectiveness of active learning, as well as value of negative feedback in this task scenario.},

abstract={Spectral clustering is a widely used method for organizing data that only relies on pairwise similarity measurements. This makes its application to non-vectorial data straight-forward in principle, as long as all pairwise similarities are available. However, in recent years, numerous examples have emerged in which the cost of assessing similarities is substantial or prohibitive. We propose an active learning algorithm for spectral clustering that incrementally measures only those similarities that are most likely to remove uncertainty in an intermediate clustering solution. In many applications, similarities are not only costly to compute, but also noisy. We extend our algorithm to maintain running estimates of the true similarities, as well as estimates of their accuracy. Using this information, the algorithm updates only those estimates which are relatively inaccurate and whose update would most likely remove clustering uncertainty. We compare our methods on several datasets, including a realistic example where similarities are expensive and noisy. The results show a significant improvement in performance compared to the alternatives. © 2012 ACM.},

To this aim we propose a novel active learning algorithm that relies on a k-nearest neighbors graph and a new constraint utility function to generate queries to the human expert. This mechanism is paired with propagation and refinement processes that limit the number of constraint candidates and introduce a minimal diversity in the proposed constraints. Existing constraint selection heuristics are based on a random selection or on a minmax criterion and thus are either inefficient or more adapted to spherical clusters. Contrary to these approaches, our method is designed to be beneficial for all constraint-based clustering algorithms. Comparative experiments conducted on real datasets and with two distinct representative constraint-based clustering algorithms show that our approach significantly improves clustering quality while minimizing the number of human expert solicitations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract={Statistical analysis and pattern recognition have become a daunting endeavour in face of the enormous amount of information in datasets that have continually been made available. In view of the infeasibility of complete manual annotation, one seeks active learning methods for data organization, selection and prioritization that could help the user to label the samples. These methods, however, classify and reorganize the entire dataset at each iteration, and as the datasets grow, they become blatantly inefficient from the user's point of view. In this work, we propose an active learning paradigm which considerably reduces the non-annotated dataset into a small set of relevant samples for learning. During active learning, random samples are selected from this small learning set and the user annotates only the misclassified ones. A training set with new labelled samples increases at each iteration and improves the classifier for the next one. When the user is satisfied, the classifier can be used to annotate the rest of the dataset. To illustrate the effectiveness of this paradigm, we developed an instance based on the optimum path forest (OPF) classifier, while relying on clustering and classification for the learning process. By using this method, we were able to iteratively generate classifiers that improve quickly, to require few iterations, and to attain high accuracy while keeping user involvement to a minimum. We also show that the method provides better accuracies on unseen test sets with less user involvement than a baseline approach based on the OPF classifier and random selection of training samples from the entire dataset.},

This work presents a data-driven non-parametric Bayesian model, based on Gaussian Processes, to model normal shipping behaviour. This model is learned from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and uses an Active Learning paradigm to select an informative subsample of the data to reduce the computational complexity of training. The resultant model allows a measure of normality to be calculated for each newly-observed transmission according to its velocity given its current latitude and longitude. Using this measure of normality, ships can be identified as potentially anomalous and prioritised for further investigation. The model performance is assessed by its ability to detect artificially generated AIS anomalies at locations around the United Kingdom. Finally, the model is demonstrated on case studies from artificial and real vessel data to detect anomalies in unusual tracks. © 2012 ISIF (Intl Society of Information Fusi).},

While previous interactive algorithms require the user to provide tedious interactions to identify all the planes in the scene, we build on successful ideas from the automatic algorithms and introduce the idea of active learning, thereby improving the reconstructions while considerably reducing the effort. Our algorithm first attempts to obtain a piecewise planar reconstruction of the scene automatically through an energy minimization framework. The proposed active-learning algorithm then uses intuitive cues to quantify the uncertainty of the algorithm and suggest regions, querying the user to provide support for the uncertain regions via simple scribbles. These interactions are used to suitably update the algorithm, leading to better reconstructions. We show through machine experiments and a user study that the proposed approach can intelligently query users for interactions on informative regions, and users can achieve better reconstructions of the scene faster, especially for scenes with texture-less surfaces lacking cues like lines which automatic algorithms rely on. © 2011 IEEE.},

This paper proposes a novel active learning method called RIQY (Rule Induced active learning QuerY). It can construct generic active learning queries based on rule induction from multiple unlabeled instances. These queries are shorter and more readable for the oracle and encompass many similar cases. Also the learning algorithm can achieve higher accuracy rates by asking fewer queries.

abstract={Nowadays, audio event detection is a hot research, the detection needs large amounts of labeled samples for training audio event models, the shortage of such labeled samples is a big obstacle. Currently, active learning is a common method in dealing with the problem of insufficient labeled samples. The most popular support vector machine active learning is to query the sample closest to the current hyperplane, but when the current hyperplane is far away from the true hyperplane, the sample closest to the current hyperplane is not so informative to be a good choice. In order to select more informative samples whenever the current hyperplane is close to or far away from the true hyperplane, this paper proposes margin and misclassification character based sampling (MMCBS) active learning, MMCBS queries the sample that is close to the current hyperplane and meanwhile is more likely to be misclassified. SVM is only interested in support vectors on the boundary, while boundary samples are easy to be misclassified, since MMCBS considers the misclassification character, so the selected samples of MMCBS are more likely to be the informative support vectors. Experiments show that MMCBS achieves higher classification accuracy with less human annotation on the melodrama Friends corpus, it is suitable for classification with scarce labeled data.},

abstract={Recommender systems help web users to address information overload. However their performance depends on the number of provided ratings by users. This problem is amplified for a new user because he/she has not provided any rating. To address this problem, active learning methods have been proposed to acquire those ratings from users, that will help most in determining their interests. However, different from the classic active learning, users (the "oracle") are not always able to provide an answer for queries. The easiest way to solve this problem is to ask most popular items, i.e items which have received many ratings from training users. But it is static and presents the same items to all users re- gardless of the ratings they have provided so far. In this paper we propose a method that improves the most popular selection strategy using the characteristics of matrix factorization. It finds similar users to the new user in the latent space and then selects item which is most popular among the similar users. The experimental results show the proposed method outperforms the most popular method both in terms of error and the number of received ratings.

In the context of online learning, a greedy, fast and provably near-optimal algorithm is employed to sequentially maximize the mutual information between past and future observations, taking advantage of submodularity properties. Additionally, a simpler procedure, which directly uses the posterior parameters learned by the Bayesian approach, is shown to achieve slightly lower estimation quality, with far less computational effort.

abstract={Counting craters is a fundamental task of planetary science, because it provides the only tool for measuring relative ages of planetary surfaces. In this paper, we combine active learning with semi-supervised learning to build an new semisupervised active class selection system for crater detection from high resolution panchromatic planetary images. We propose the Semi-supervised Active Class Selection Algorithm to iteratively enrich an original small training set, without additional human labeling effort, to detect craters from a large volume of images. We propose two strategies to improve detection accuracy by integrating classification with exploration on unlabeled samples. The Majority Vote Strategy is used to automatically obtain class labels by exploiting unlabeled samples from test images. In the same time, the Active Stability Strategy is used to obtain an appropriate class distribution in the constructed training set by detecting unstable classes. By using those two strategies, we actively select test instances from test images into an existing small initial training set while re-learning the classifier in the mean time. The proposed algorithm is empirically evaluated on a large challenging Martian image, exhibiting a heavily cratered Martian terrain characterized by heterogeneous surface morphology. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a higher accuracy than other existing approaches to a large extent. © 2011 University of Zagreb.},

abstract={Automated recognition of facial expressions is an important problem in computer vision applications. Due to the vagueness in class definitions, expression recognition is often conceived as a fuzzy label problem. Annotating a data point in such a problem involves significant manual effort. Active learning techniques are effective in reducing human labeling effort to induce a classification model as they automatically select the salient and exemplar instances from vast amounts of unlabeled data. Further, to address the high redundancy in data such as image or video sequences as well as to account for the presence of multiple labeling agents, there have been recent attempts towards a batch mode form of active learning where a batch of data points is selected simultaneously from an unlabeled set. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based batch mode active learning technique for fuzzy label classification problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to develop such a scheme primarily intended for the fuzzy label context. The proposed algorithm is computationally simple, easy to implement and has provable performance bounds. Our results on facial expression datasets corroborate the efficacy of the framework in reducing human annotation effort in real world recognition applications involving fuzzy labels. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Audio event detection has become a hot research due to its wide applications in many fields, such as multimedia retrieval etc., the detection needs large amounts of labeled samples to train the audio event models, but in real life, the labeled samples are expensive to obtain, the shortage of such labeled samples is a big obstacle. Active learning is an efficient way to deal with the problem of insufficient labeled samples. The most popular support vector machines active learning is the margin based sampling (MBS), which is to query the sample closest to the current hyperplane, but when the current hyperplane is far away from the true hyperplane, the sample closest to the current hyperplane is not so informative, querying such samples would have a much slower adjustment of the hyperplane. In order to accelerate the adjustment, this paper proposes the misclassification and margin based sampling (MMBS) active learning algorithm. In order to query more informative samples, MMBS selects samples based on misclassified samples' KL divergence in the first few iterations, after that, considering the lower misclassification confidence and the outlier problem, it switches to MBS. Experiments show that compared to MBS and representative sampling (RepS), MMBS can get the highest detection performance under the same human annotation workload.},

Uncertainty of samples is assessed by conditional entropy that is defined on the basis of class-conditional independence assumption in time domain.

abstract={In remote sensing image classification, it is commonly assumed that the distribution of the classes is stable over the entire image. This way, training pixels labeled by photointerpretation are assumed to be representative of the whole image. However, differences in distribution of the classes throughout the image make this assumption weak and a model built on a single area may be suboptimal when applied to the rest of the image. In this paper, we investigate the use of active learning to correct the shifts that may appear when training and test data do not come from the same distribution. Experiments are carried out on a VHR remote sensing classification scenario showing that active learning can effectively learn the covariance shift and provide robust solutions. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Semi-supervised clustering aims to improve clustering performance by considering user supervision in the form of pairwise constraints. In this paper, we study the active learning problem of selecting pairwise must-link and cannot-link constraints for semi-supervised clustering. We consider active learning in an iterative manner where in each iteration queries are selected based on the current clustering solution and the existing constraint set. We apply a general framework that builds on the concept of neighborhood, where neighborhoods contain "labeled examples" of different clusters according to the pairwise constraints. Our active learning method expands the neighborhoods by selecting informative points and querying their relationship with the neighborhoods. Under this framework, we build on the classic uncertainty-based principle and present a novel approach for computing the uncertainty associated with each data point. We further introduce a selection criterion that trades off the amount of uncertainty of each data point with the expected number of queries (the cost) required to resolve this uncertainty. This allows us to select queries that have the highest information rate. We evaluate the proposed method on the benchmark data sets and the results demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over the current state of the art. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A key issue for the realization of the smart grid vision is the implementation of effective demand-side management. One possible approach involves exposing dynamic energy prices to end-users. In this paper, we consider a resulting problem on the user's side: how to adaptively heat a home given dynamic prices. The user faces the challenge of having to react to dynamic prices in real time, trading off his comfort with the costs of heating his home to a certain temperature. We propose an active learning approach to adjust the home temperature in a semiautomatic way. Our algorithm learns the user's preferences over time and automatically adjusts the temperature in real-time as prices change. In addition, the algorithm asks the user for feedback once a day. To find the best query time, the algorithm solves an optimal stopping problem. Via simulations, we show that our algorithm learns users' preferences quickly, and that using the expected utility loss as the query criterion outperforms standard approaches from the active learning literature.},

As a particularly interesting application, we study in detail the benefits of transfer for self-verifying active learning; in this setting, we find that the number of labeled examples required for learning with transfer is often significantly smaller than that required for learning each target independently. © 2012 The Author(s).},

Thus, there is considerable interest in automated systems for real-time monitoring of arrhythmia. However, intra and inter-patient variability as well as the computational limits of real-time monitoring poses significant challenges for practical implementations. The former requires that the classification model be adjusted continuously, and the latter requires a reduction in the number and types of ECG features, and thus, the computational burden, necessary to classify different arrhythmias. We propose the use of adaptive learning to automatically train the classifier on up-to-date ECG data, and employ adaptive feature selection to define unique feature subsets pertinent to different types of arrhythmia. Experimental results show that this hybrid technique outperforms conventional approaches and is therefore a promising new intelligent diagnostic tool. © 2013 KSII.},

abstract={A key problem of robotic environmental sensing and monitoring is that of active sensing: How can a team of robots plan the most informative observation paths to minimize the uncertainty in modeling and predicting an environmental phenomenon? This paper presents two principled approaches to efficient information-theoretic path planning based on entropy and mutual information criteria for in situ active sensing of an important broad class of widely-occurring environmental phenomena called anisotropic fields. Our proposed algorithms are novel in addressing a trade-off between active sensing performance and time efficiency. An important practical consequence is that our algorithms can exploit the spatial correlation structure of Gaussian process-based anisotropic fields to improve time efficiency while preserving near-optimal active sensing performance. We analyze the time complexity of our algorithms and prove analytically that they scale better than state-of-the-art algorithms with increasing planning horizon length. We provide theoretical guarantees on the active sensing performance of our algorithms for a class of exploration tasks called transect sampling, which, in particular, can be improved with longer planning time and/or lower spatial correlation along the transect. Empirical evaluation on real-world anisotropic field data shows that our algorithms can perform better or at least as well as the state-of-the-art algorithms while often incurring a few orders of magnitude less computational time, even when the field conditions are less favorable.

One of the key research points in active learning is how to select the most effective samples. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning approach based on sparse graph. Comparing with the existing active learning approaches, the proposed method selects the samples based on two criteria: uncertainty and representativeness. The representativeness indicates the contribution of a sample's label propagating to the other samples, while the existing approaches did not take the representativeness into consideration. Extensive experiments show that bringing the representativeness criterion into the sample selection process can significantly improve the active learning effectiveness. © 2012 KSII.},

abstract={One motivation for property testing of boolean functions is the idea that testing can provide a fast preprocessing step before learning. However, in most machine learning applications, it is not possible to request for labels of arbitrary examples constructed by an algorithm. Instead, the dominant query paradigm in applied machine learning, called*active learning*, is one where the algorithm may query for labels, but only on points in a given (polynomial-sized) unlabeled sample, drawn from some underlying distribution D. In this work, we bring this well-studied model to the domain of testing. We develop both general results for this active testing model as well as efficient testing algorithms for several important properties for learning, demonstrating that testing can still yield substantial benefits in this restricted setting. For example, we show that testing unions of d intervals can be done with O(1) label requests in our setting, whereas it is known to require Ω(d) labeled examples for learning (and Ω(√d) for passive testing [22] where the algorithm must pay for every example drawn from D). In fact, our results for testing unions of intervals also yield improvements on prior work in both the classic query model (where any point in the domain can be queried) and the passive testing model as well. For the problem of testing linear separators in R^n over the Gaussian distribution, we show that both active and passive testing can be done with Ω(√n) queries, substantially less than the Ω(n) needed for learning, with near-matching lower bounds. We also present a general combination result in this model for building testable properties out of others, which we then use to provide testers for a number of assumptions used in semi-supervised learning. In addition to the above results, we also develop a general notion of the*testing dimension* of a given property with respect to a given distribution, that we show characterizes (up to constant factors) the intrinsic number of label requests needed to test that property. We develop such notions for both the active and passive testing models. We then use these dimensions to prove a number of lower bounds, including for linear separators and the class of dictator functions. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In lots of important applications, such as malignant cell detection, network intrusion detection, error signal detection in power system, the data distributions of positive and negative classes are usually imbalance. Many classifiers could not perform well in data imbalance cases. The major problem is that classifiers tend to ignore samples and accuracy of the minority class without regarding the higher cost of misclassification in this minor class. Therefore, pattern classification for imbalance data becomes a hot challenge to both academy and industry. In this paper, we propose an active learning method for imbalance data using a stochastic sensitivity measure (ST-SM) of Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). A large ST-SM indicates the RBFNN is uncertain and yields a large output fluctuation around a particular sample. These samples yielding large ST-SM values are selected for adding to the training set in each turn. Empirically, samples with large output perturbation (i.e. large ST-SM) should be located near the classification boundary and is of great significance for the training of classifier. As for the imbalance characteristic of the data set, the ST-SM should be able to reduce the number of redundant samples being selected in the majority class, rebalance the sample distribution of the training set, and finally improve the performance of the classifier. © 2012 IEEE.},

Specifically, our co-selecting approach employs two feature subspace classifiers to collectively select most informative minority-class samples for manual annotation by leveraging a certainty measurement and an uncertainty measurement, and in the meanwhile, automatically label most informative majority-class samples, to reduce human-annotation efforts. Extensive experiments across four domains demonstrate great potential and effectiveness of our proposed co-selecting approach to active learning for imbalanced sentiment classification. © 2012 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract={One difficulty with machine learning for information extraction is the high cost of collecting labeled examples. Active Learning can make more efficient use of the learner's time by asking them to label only instances that are most useful for the trainer. In random sampling approach, unlabeled data is selected for annotation at random and thus can't yield the desired results. In contrast, active learning selects the useful data from a huge pool of unlabeled data for the classifier. The strategies used often classify the corpus tokens (or, data points) under wrong classes. The classifier is confused between two categories if the token is located near the margin. We develop a method for solving this problem and show that it favorably results in the increased performance. Our approach is based on the supervised machine learner, Conditional Random Field (CRF). The proposed approach is applied for solving the problem of named entity extraction from biomedical domain. Results show that proposed active learning based technique indeed improves the performance of the system. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper we present a practical optimization to active automata learning that reduces the average execution time per query as well as the number of actual tests to be executed. Key to our optimization are two observations: (1) establishing well-defined initial conditions for a test (reset) is a very expensive operation on real systems, as it usually involves modifications to the persisted state of the system (e.g., a database). (2) In active learning many of the (sequentially) produced queries are extensions of previous queries. We exploit these observations by using the same test run on a real system for multiple "compatible" queries. We maintain a pool of runs on the real system (system states), and execute only suffixes of queries on the real system whenever possible. The optimizations allow us to apply active learning to an industry-scale web-application running on an enterprise platform: the Online Conference Service (OCS) an online service-oriented manuscript submission and review system. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={A central problem in environmental sensing and monitoring is to classify/label the hotspots in a large-scale environmental field. This paper presents a novel decentralized active robotic exploration (DARE) strategy for probabilistic classification/labeling of hotspots in a Gaussian process (GP)-based field. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art exploration strategies for learning environmental field maps, the time needed to solve the DARE strategy is independent of the map resolution and the number of robots, thus making it practical for in situ, real-time active sampling. Its exploration behavior exhibits an interesting formal trade-off between that of boundary tracking until the hotspot region boundary can be accurately predicted and wide-area coverage to find new boundaries in sparsely sampled areas to be tracked. We provide a theoretical guarantee on the active exploration performance of the DARE strategy: under reasonable conditional independence assumption, we prove that it can optimally achieve two formal cost-minimizing exploration objectives based on the misclassification and entropy criteria. Importantly, this result implies that the uncertainty of labeling the hotspots in a GP-based field is greatest at or close to the hotspot region boundaries. Empirical evaluation on real-world plankton density and temperature field data shows that, subject to limited observations, DARE strategy can achieve more superior classification of hotspots and time efficiency than state-of-the-art active exploration strategies.

abstract={Multi-label classification is a generalization of conventional classification, where it is possible for a single data point to have multiple labels. Manual annotation of a multi-label data point requires a human oracle to consider the presence/absence of every possible class separately, which involves significant labor. Active learning techniques are effective in reducing human labeling effort to induce a classification model. When exposed to large quantities of unlabeled data, such algorithms automatically select the salient and representative instances for manual annotation. Further, to address the high redundancy in data such as image or video sequences as well as the availability of multiple labeling agents, there have been recent attempts towards a batch mode form of active learning, where a batch of data points is selected simultaneously from an unlabeled set. In this work, we propose a novel optimization based batch mode active learning strategy to minimize human labeling effort in multi-label classification problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop such a scheme primarily intended for the multi-label context. The proposed framework is computationally simple, easy to implement and can be suitably modified to perform batch mode active learning in other formulations, such as single-label classification or problems involving hierarchical label spaces. Our results corroborate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and certify the potential of the framework in being used for real world applications. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

Our approach is based on the combination of stable solutions of matching problems and active learning with the time-efficient link discovery framework LIMES. RAVEN aims at requiring a small number of interactions with the user to generate classifiers of high accuracy. We focus on using RAVEN to compute and configure boolean and weighted classifiers, which we evaluate in three experiments against link specifications created manually. Our evaluation shows that we can compute linking configurations that achieve more than 90% F-score by asking the user to verify at most twelve potential links.},

abstract={This paper describes a new technique and analysis for using on-line learning algorithms to solve active learning problems. Our algorithm is called Active Vote, and it works by actively selecting instances that force several perturbed copies of an on-line algorithm to make mistakes. The main intuition for our result is based on the fact that the number of mistakes made by the optimal on-line algorithm is a lower bound on the number of labels needed for active learning. We provide performance bounds for Active Vote in both a batch and on-line model of active learning. These performance bounds depend on the algorithm having a set of unlabeled instances in which the various perturbed on-line algorithms disagree. The motivating application for Active Vote is an Internet advertisement rating program. We conduct experiments using data collected for this advertisement problem along with experiments using standard datasets. We show Active Vote can achieve an order of magnitude decrease in the number of labeled instances over various passive learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

To confirm our argument, we propose three initial training data selection mechanisms based on fuzzy clustering method: center-based selection, border-based selection and hybrid selection. Center-based selection selects the samples with high degree of membership in each cluster as initial training data. Border-based selection selects the samples around the border between clusters. Hybrid selection is the combination of center-based selection and border-based selection. The effects of them are empirically studied on a set of UCI data sets.

abstract={As a recently proposed machine learning method, active learning of Gaussian processes can effectively use a small number of labeled examples to train a classifier, which in turn is used to select the most informative examples from unlabeled data for manual labeling. However, in the process of example selection, active learning usually need consider all the unlabeled data without exploiting the structural space connectivity among them. This will decrease the classification accuracy to some extent since the selected points may not be the most informative. To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we present a method which applies the manifold-preserving graph reduction (MPGR) algorithm to the traditional active learning method of Gaussian processes. MPGR is a simple and efficient example sparsification algorithm which can construct a subset to represent the global structure and simultaneously eliminate the influence of noisy points and outliers. Thereby, when actively selecting examples to label, we just choose from the subset constructed by MPGR instead of the whole unlabeled data. We report experimental results on multiple data sets which demonstrate that our method obtains better classification performance compared with the original active learning method of Gaussian processes. © 2014 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={Active learning is a protocol for supervised machine learning, in which a learning algorithm sequentially requests the labels of selected data points from a large pool of unlabeled data. This contrasts with passive learning, where the labeled data are taken at random. The objective in active learning is to produce a highly-accurate classifier, ideally using fewer labels than the number of random labeled data sufficient for passive learning to achieve the same. This article describes recent advances in our understanding of the theoretical benefits of active learning, and implications for the design of effective active learning algorithms. Much of the article focuses on a particular technique, namely disagreementbased active learning, which by now has amassed a mature and coherent literature. It also briefly surveys several alternative approaches from the literature. The emphasis is on theorems regarding the performance of a few general algorithms, including rigorous proofs where appropriate. However, the presentation is intended to be pedagogical, focusing on results that illustrate fundamental ideas, rather than obtaining the strongest or most general known theorems.

abstract={The use of relative attributes for semantic understanding of images and videos is a promising way to improve communication between humans and machines. However, it is extremely labor- and time-consuming to define multiple attributes for each instance in large amount of data. One option is to incorporate active learning, so that the informative samples can be actively discovered and then labeled. However, most existing active-learning methods select samples one at a time (serial mode), and may therefore lose efficiency when learning multiple attributes. In this paper, we propose a batch-mode active-learning method, called diverse expected gradient active learning. This method integrates an informativeness analysis and a diversity analysis to form a diverse batch of queries. Specifically, the informativeness analysis employs the expected pairwise gradient length as a measure of informativeness, while the diversity analysis forces a constraint on the proposed diverse gradient angle. Since simultaneous optimization of these two parts is intractable, we utilize a two-step procedure to obtain the diverse batch of queries. A heuristic method is also introduced to suppress imbalanced multiclass distributions. Empirical evaluations of three different databases demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 1992-2012 IEEE.},

Using active learning, we learn a model MR of reference implementation R, which serves as input for a model-based testing tool that checks conformance of implementation I to MR. In addition, we also explore an alternative approach in which we learn a model MI of implementation I, which is compared to model MR using an equivalence checker. Our work uses a unique combination of software tools for model construction (Uppaal), active learning (LearnLib, Tomte), model-based testing (JTorX, TorXakis) and verification (CADP, MRMC).

In parallel, needs for efficient active learning methods are raised in real-world applications. As an illustration, we present in this paper an active learning challenge applied to a real-world application named Nomao. Nomao is a search engine of places. It aggregates information coming from multiple sources on the web to propose complete information related to a place. In this context, active learning is used to efficiently detect data that refer to a same place. The process is called data deduplication. Since it is a real-world application, some additional constraints have to be handled. The main ones are scalability of the proposed method, representativeness of the training dataset, and practicality of the labeling process. The website of the challenge remains open beyond the termination of the challenge as a resource for students and researchers (http://www.nomao.com/labs/challenge) and to share that problem with the community, the whole labeled dataset has been delivered publicly to the UCI Machine Learning Repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/ datasets/Nomao) © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new algorithm to compute the resilience of a social system or an ecosystem when it is defined in the framework of the mathematical viability theory. It is applied to the problem of language coexistence: Although bilingual societies do exist, many languages have disappeared and some seem endangered presently. Mathematical models of language competition generally conclude that one language will disappear, except when the relative prestige of the languages can be modified. The viability theory provides concepts and tools that are suitable to study the resilience, but with severe computational limits since it uses extensive search on regular grids. The method we propose considers the computation of the viability output sets as an active learning problem with the objective of restraining the number of calls to the model and information storage. We adapt a kd-tree algorithm to approximate the level sets of the resilience value. We prove that this algorithm converges to the output sets defined by the viability theory (viability kernel and capture basin). The resilience value we compute can then be used to propose a policy of action in risky situations such as migration flows.},

abstract={Pattern mining provides useful tools for exploratory data analysis. Numerous efficient algorithms exist that are able to discover various types of patterns in large datasets. However, the problem of identifying patterns that are genuinely interesting to a particular user remains challenging. Current approaches generally require considerable data mining expertise or effort and hence cannot be used by typical domain experts. We show that it is possible to resolve this issue by interactive learning of user-specific pattern ranking functions, where a user ranks small sets of patterns and a general ranking function is inferred from this feedback by preference learning techniques. We present a general framework for learning pattern ranking functions and propose a number of active learning heuristics that aim at minimizing the required user effort. In particular we focus on Subgroup Discovery, a specific pattern mining task. We evaluate the capacity of the algorithm to learn a ranking of a subgroup set defined by a complex quality measure, given only reasonably small sample rankings. Experiments demonstrate that preference learning has the capacity to learn accurate rankings and that active learning heuristics help reduce the required user effort. Moreover, using learned ranking functions as search heuristics allows discovering subgroups of substantially higher quality than those in the given set. This shows that active preference learning is potentially an important building block of interactive pattern mining systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

Though active learning has been widely studied on reducing labeling effort for single-label problems, current research on multi-label active learning remains in a preliminary state. In this paper, we first propose two novel multi-label active learning strategies, a max-margin prediction uncertainty strategy and a label cardinality inconsistency strategy, and then integrate them into an adaptive framework of multi-label active learning. Our empirical results on multiple multilabel data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed active instance selection strategies and the integrated active learning approach.},

abstract={Recommender systems, especially the newly launched ones, have to deal with the data-sparsity issue, where little existing rating information is available. Recently, transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging the knowledge from related recommender systems where rich collaborative data are available. However, most previous transfer learning models assume that entity-correspondences across different systems are given as input, which means that for any entity (e.g., a user or an item) in a target system, its corresponding entity in a source system is known. This assumption can hardly be satisfied in real-world scenarios where entity-correspondences across systems are usually unknown, and the cost of identifying them can be expensive. For example, it is extremely difficult to identify whether a user A from Facebook and a user B from Twitter are the same person. In this paper, we propose a framework to construct entity correspondence with limited budget by using active learning to facilitate knowledge transfer across recommender systems. Specifically, for the purpose of maximizing knowledge transfer, we first iteratively select entities in the target system based on our proposed criterion to query their correspondences in the source system. We then plug the actively constructed entity-correspondence mapping into a general transferred collaborative-filtering model to improve recommendation quality.We perform extensive experiments on real world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework for this crosssystem recommendation problem.

abstract={The goal of relevance feedback is to improve the performance of image retrieval by leveraging the labeling of human. It is helpful to introduce active learning method in relevance feedback to alleviate the human burden. In the traditional active learning the samples which can improve the classifier the most if they were labeled are selected for the user's labeling. However, the change of the geometrical structure of the data distribution caused by such expensive labeled samples is not fully exploited. By mining user's labeling information, we can reduce the original feature space dimension to ease the classifier's instability brought by the small sample size. In this paper, we propose a novel batch mode active learning method for informative data selection. The labeled samples are not only used to retrain the classifier, but to learn a subspace which efficiently encodes user's intention as well. Especially, a scheme of certainty propagation on the subspace effectively integrates uncertainty sampling and subspace learning into the proposed Subspace learning based batch mode Active Learning method (SubAL) in relevance feedback. Extensive experiments on publicly available dataset shows that the proposed method is promising. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Process discovery is the learning task that entails the construction of process models from event logs of information systems. Typically, these event logs are large data sets that contain the process executions by registering what activity has taken place at a certain moment in time. By far the most arduous challenge for process discovery algorithms consists of tackling the problem of accurate and comprehensible knowledge discovery from highly flexible environments. Event logs from such flexible systems often contain a large variety of process executions which makes the application of process mining most interesting. However, simply applying existing process discovery techniques will often yield highly incomprehensible process models because of their inaccuracy and complexity. With respect to resolving this problem, trace clustering is one very interesting approach since it allows to split up an existing event log so as to facilitate the knowledge discovery process. In this paper, we propose a novel trace clustering technique that significantly differs from previous approaches. Above all, it starts from the observation that currently available techniques suffer from a large divergence between the clustering bias and the evaluation bias. By employing an active learning inspired approach, this bias divergence is solved. In an assessment using four complex, real-life event logs, it is shown that our technique significantly outperforms currently available trace clustering techniques. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a new method for efficiently approximating the global penetration depth between two rigid objects using machine learning techniques. Our approach consists of two phases: offline learning and performing run-time queries. In the learning phase, we precompute an approximation of the contact space of a pair of intersecting objects from a set of samples in the configuration space. We use active and incremental learning algorithms to accelerate the precomputation and improve the accuracy. During the run-time phase, our algorithm performs a nearest-neighbor query based on translational or rotational distance metrics. The run-time query has a small overhead and computes an approximation to global penetration depth in a few milliseconds. We use our algorithm for collision response computations in Box2D or Bullet game physics engines and complex 3D models and observe more than an order of magnitude improvement over prior PD computation techniques.},

abstract={In semi-supervised learning, when the number of data samples with class label information is very small, information from unlabeled data is utilized in the learning process. Many semi-supervised learning methods have been presented and have exhibited competent performance. Active learning also aims to overcome the shortage of labeled data by obtaining class labels for some selected unlabeled data from experts. However, the selection process for the most informative unlabeled data samples can be demanding when the search is performed over a large set of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a method for batch mode active learning in graph-based semi-supervised learning. Instead of acquiring class label information of one unlabeled data sample at a time, we obtain information about several data samples at once, reducing time complexity while preserving the beneficial effects of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

However, the main barrier of broad adoption is the labor-intensive process of collecting labeled fingerprints. In this work, we propose an approach for reducing the amount of labeled data instances required for training a Wi-Fi fingerprint model. The reduction of the labeling effort is achieved by leveraging dead reckoning and an active learning-based approach for selecting data instances for labeling.

abstract={We consider the problem of inferring the topology of an M-by-N network by sending probes between M sources and N receivers. Prior work has shown that this problem can be decomposed into two parts: first, infer smaller subnetwork components (i.e., 1-by-N's or 2-by-2's) and then merge these components to identify the M-by-N topology. In this paper, we focus on the second part. In particular, we assume that a 1-by-N topology is given and that all 2-by-2 components can be queried and learned using end-to-end probes. The problem is which 2-by-2's to query and how to merge them with the 1-by-N, so as to exactly identify the 2-by-N topology, and optimize a number of performance metrics including measurement traffic, time complexity, and memory usage. We provide a lower bound, ¿ N over 2 ¿, on the number of 2-by-2's required by any active learning algorithm and we also propose a greedy algorithm that is near-optimal and efficient in practice. It follows a bottom-up approach: at every step, it selects two receivers, queries the corresponding 2-by-2, and merges it with the given 1-by-N. The algorithm requires exactly N ¿ 1 steps, which is much less than all (N over 2) possible 2-by-2's, and it correctly identifies the 2-by-N topology. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Most of existing works on primary user (PU) localization locate primary transmitter (PT) while the purpose of localization is to avoid interfering with primary receiver (PR). Therefore, it is more important to locate PR. In this paper, we propose a PR localization method based on active learning. The secondary user (SU) initiatively sends a probing signal to interfere with the PU, then the PU adapts transmit power and/or rate upon the interference signal and such transmit adaptations are observed by the SU, whereby the SU learns the PU's strategy for transmit adaptations. From the observation, the SU estimates the distance between the PR and the SU. Finally, the location of the PR can be estimated by maximum likelihood estimation without prior information of the PR transmission power. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes under different system setups. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={We describe a framework for designing efficient active learning algorithms that are tolerant to random classification noise and differentially-private. The framework is based on active learning algorithms that are statistical in the sense that they rely on estimates of expectations of functions of filtered random examples. It builds on the powerful statistical query framework of Kearns [30]. We show that any efficient active statistical learning algorithm can be automatically converted to an efficient active learning algorithm which is tolerant to random classification noise as well as other forms of "uncorrelated" noise. We show that commonly studied concept classes including thresholds, rectangles, and linear separators can be efficiently actively learned in our framework. These results combined with our generic conversion lead to the first computationally-efficient algorithms for actively learning some of these concept classes in the presence of random classification noise that provide exponential improvement in the dependence on the error ε over their passive counterparts. In addition, we show that our algorithms can be automatically converted to efficient active differentially-private algorithms. This leads to the first differentially-private active learning algorithms with exponential label savings over the passive case.},

Our simulation experiments on three document classification tasks show that some interruption is almost always better than none, but that the optimal interruption time varies by dataset. © Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract={In many practical applications of active learning, it is more cost-effective to request labels in large batches, rather than one-at-a-time. This is because the cost of labeling a large batch of examples at once is often sublinear in the number of examples in the batch. In this work, we study the label complexity of active learning algorithms that request labels in a given number of batches, as well as the tradeoff between the total number of queries and the number of rounds allowed. We additionally study the total cost sufficient for learning, for an abstract notion of the cost of requesting the labels of a given number of examples at once. In particular, we find that for sublinear cost functions, it is often desirable to request labels in large batches (i.e., buying in bulk); although this may increase the total number of labels requested, it reduces the total cost required for learning.},

abstract={Cross-lingual sentiment classification aims to predict the sentiment orientation of a text in a language (named as the target language) with the help of the resources from another language (named as the source language). However, current cross-lingual performance is normally far away from satisfaction due to the huge difference in linguistic expression and social culture. In this paper, we suggest to perform active learning for cross-lingual sentiment classification, where only a small scale of samples are actively selected and manually annotated to achieve reasonable performance in a short time for the target language. The challenge therein is that there are normally much more labeled samples in the source language than those in the target language. This makes the small amount of labeled samples from the target language flooded in the aboundance of labeled samples from the source language, which largely reduces their impact on cross-lingual sentiment classification. To address this issue, we propose a data quality controlling approach in the source language to select high-quality samples from the source language. Specifically, we propose two kinds of data quality measurements, intra- and extra-quality measurements, from the certainty and similarity perspectives. Empirical studies verify the appropriateness of our active learning approach to cross-lingual sentiment classification. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={Every day, lifelogging devices, available for recording difierent aspects of our daily life, increase in number, quality and functions, just like the multiple applications that we give to them. Applying wearable devices to analyse the nutritional habits of people is a challenging application based on acquiring and analyzing life records in long periods of time. However, to extract the information of interest related to the eating patterns of people, we need automatic methods to process large amount of life-logging data (e.g. recognition of food-related objects). Creating a rich set of manually labeled samples to train the algorithms is slow, tedious and subjective. To address this problem, we propose a novel method in the framework of Active Labeling for constructing a training set of thousands of images. Inspired by the hierarchical sampling method for active learning [6], we propose an Active forest that organizes hierarchically the data for easy and fast labeling. Moreover, introducing a classifier into the hierarchical structures, as well as transforming the feature space for better data clustering, additionally improve the algorithm. Our method is successfully tested to label 89.700 food-related objects and achieves significant reduction in expert time labelling. © Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Defining an efficient training set is one of the most delicate phases for the success of remote sensing image classification routines. The complexity of the problem, the limited temporal and financial resources, as well as the high intra-class variance can make an algorithm fail if it is trained with a suboptimal dataset. Active learning technique seeks to interactively construct a smaller and optimal training data set that is the most informative and useful for the classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm which not only considers the smallest distance to the decision hyperplanes, but also takes into account the manifold structure by using graph Laplacian of the selected samples. The manifold structure is applied to find the representative sample for the classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing it with other active learning techniques existing in the literature. Experimental results on data set confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed technique. © 2013 Binary Information Press.},

However, in reality, there are many applications in which the set of possible labels are often organized in a hierarchical structure. In this paper, we consider the problem of active learning when the categories are represented as a tree. Our goal is to exploit the structure information of the label tree in active learning to select the most informative samples to be labeled. We propose an algorithm that estimates the semantic space, embedding the category hierarchy. In this space, each category label is represented as a prototype and the uncertainty is measured using a variance-based fashion.

abstract={The present paper proposes a tool to help analysts make tourism development ideas while reading blog articles. Since reading the entire text of an article is time consuming, it is useful to extract from the blog articles significant sentences that are relevant to tourism development. The proposed tool extracts such sentences using a support vector machine (SVM) and an active learning method. In the first learning step, the proposed tool is trained using corpora that include hint-tags. The analyst then provides target blog articles to the tool and receives sentences as the results of the SVM classification. Some of these sentences are analyzed manually in order to annotate new hint-tags. In the second learning step, both the original corpora and the annotation results are used. Finally, the analyst reads plausible sentences extracted from the second classification of the target articles. In the experiments, we confirmed that the proposed active learning method provides better results than the simple learning method. © 2012 IEEE.},

It avoids tedious retraining with each selected sample, and is effective to utilize multiple labelers.

While efficient, such a greedy active learning approach cannot guarantee the learner's performance. In this paper, we introduce a near-optimal non-myopic active learning algorithm that is efficient and simultaneously has a performance guarantee. Our experimental results on UCI data sets and a real-world application show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the myopic active learning method and the existing non-myopic active learning methods in both efficiency and accuracy. © 2012 ICPR Org Committee.},

It is also difficult to properly deal with multi-source data simply by traditional classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning classification system to solve these problems. Firstly, the adaptive query by committee (AQBC) strategy could reduce the need of known labeled samples and meanwhile provide more accurate predictions of the actively selected unlabeled samples to further decrease misclassifying rates. In addition, the involved basic classifier based on the optimized Meta-Gaussian distribution could better fuse different types of feature sources. Finally, compared with other traditional methods, the experiment results show that the proposed classification system could improve classification accuracies effectively and make full use of the limited training samples in multi-source data sets. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Evolutionary optimization is often applied to problems, where simulations or experiments used as the fitness function are expensive to run. In such cases, surrogate models are used to reduce the number of fitness evaluations. Some of the problems also require a fixed size batch of solutions to be evaluated at a time. Traditional methods of selecting individuals for true evaluation to improve the surrogate model either require individual points to be evaluated, or couple the batch size with the EA generation size. We propose a queue based method for individual selection based on active learning of a kriging model. Individuals are selected using the confidence intervals predicted by the model, added to a queue and evaluated once the queue length reaches the batch size. The method was tested on several standard benchmark problems. Results show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve a solution using significantly less evaluations of the true fitness function. The effect of the batch size as well as other parameters is discussed.},

abstract={In many applications of data mining it is known before- hand that the response variable should be increasing (or decreasing) in the attributes. We propose two al- gorithms to exploit such monotonicity constraints for active learning in ordinal classification in two different settings. The basis of our approach is the observation that if the class label of an object is given, then the monotonicity constraints may allow the labels of other objects to be inferred. For instance, from knowing that loan applicant a is rejected, it can be concluded that all applicants that score worse than a on all criteria should be rejected as well. We propose two heuristics to select good query points. These heuristics make a se- lection based on a point's potential to determine the la- bels of other points. The algorithms, each implemented with the proposed heuristics, are evaluated on artificial and real data sets to study their performance. We con- clude that exploitation of monotonicity constraints can be very beneficial in active learning. Copyright © 2012 by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract={Active learning methods can dramatically improve the yield of neurophysiology experiments by adaptively selecting stimuli to probe a neuron's receptive field (RF). Bayesian active learning methods specify a posterior distribution over the RF given the data collected so far in the experiment, and select a stimulus on each time step that maximally reduces posterior uncertainty. However, existing methods tend to employ simple Gaussian priors over the RF and do not exploit uncertainty at the level of hyperparameters. Incorporating this uncertainty can substantially speed up active learning, particularly when RFs are smooth, sparse, or local in space and time. Here we describe a novel framework for active learning under hierarchical, conditionally Gaussian priors. Our algorithm uses sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling ("particle filtering" with MCMC) to construct a mixture-of-Gaussians representation of the RF posterior, and selects optimal stimuli using an approximate infomax criterion. The core elements of this algorithm are parallelizable, making it computationally efficient for real-time experiments. We apply our algorithm to simulated and real neural data, and show that it can provide highly accurate receptive field estimates from very limited data, even with a small number of hyperparameter samples.},

abstract={Multi-view semi-supervised learning methods exploit the combination of multiple data views and unlabeled data in order to learn better predictive functions with limited labeled data. However, their applicability is limited since typically one data view is readily available but additional views may be costly to obtain. Here we explore a new research direction at the intersection of active learning and multi-view semisupervised learning: active view completion. The goal is to actively select which instances to obtain missing view data for, for the purposes of enabling effective multi-view semisupervised learning. Recent work has shown an active selection strategy for view completion can be more effective than a random one. Here a better understanding of active approaches is sought, and it is demonstrated that the effectiveness of an active selection strategy over a random one can depend on the relationship between views. We present new algorithms, theoretical results, and experimental study to elucidate the conditions for and extent to which active approaches can be beneficial in this scenario. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the main elements of a spoken dialogue system is the Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) unit. Hidden Vector State (HVS) is one of the popular statistical methods applied to the SLU component. Extended Hidden Vector State (EHVS) is an enhanced version of the HVS. Although both parsers need only abstract data annotation, it is quiet time consuming and difficult to label the data. Thus, we present a novel active learning method for the EHVS parser to reduce the human labeling effort. The active learner makes use of pattern classification to select the informative data based on four different uncertainty measures. Experiments are done on a Persian dataset, the University Information Kiosk corpus. The experimental results show the improvements in performance of the active EHVS which has been improved 15.46% in the case of entropy-probability uncertainty measure.

Typical solutions to this problem require analysis of the correlation among different attributes of the photos, including the correlation between the textual features and visual features computed from a photo. However, most on-line photos have very few tags or even no tags, and thus they contribute little or none to the analysis of tag-photo correlation, which is a key component in those schemes that rely on such analysis for tag recommendation. To address this practical challenge, we propose an active learning method for incorporating photos with no or few tags so as to enhance the correlation analysis for improved performance in tag recommendation.

It is assumed that a small number of matrix elements are initially observed, and the statistical FA model is employed to actively and sequentially select which new matrix entries would be most informative, in order to estimate the remaining missing entries, i.e., complete the matrix. The model inference and active learning are performed within an online variational Bayes (VB) framework. A fast and provably near-optimal greedy algorithm is used to sequentially maximize the mutual information contribution from new observations, taking advantage of submodularity properties. Additionally, a simple alternative procedure is proposed, in which the posterior parameters learned by the Bayesian approach are directly used. This alternative procedure is shown to achieve slightly higher prediction error, but requires much fewer computational resources. The methods are demonstrated on a very large matrix factorization problem, namely the Yahoo! Music ratings dataset. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Software quality prediction plays an important role in improving the quality of software systems. By mining software metrics, predictive models can be induced that provide software managers with insights into quality problems they need to tackle as effectively as possible. Objective: Traditional, supervised learning approaches dominate software quality prediction. Resulting models tend to be project specific. On the other hand, in situations where there are no previous releases, supervised learning approaches are not very useful because large training data sets are needed to develop accurate predictive models. Method: This paper eases the limitations of supervised learning approaches and offers good prediction performance. We propose an adaptive approach in which supervised learning and active learning are coupled together. NaiveBayes classifier is used as the base learner. Results: We track the performance at each iteration of the adaptive learning algorithm and compare it with the performance of supervised learning. Our results show that proposed scheme provides good fault prediction performance over time, i.e., it eventually outperforms the corresponding supervised learning approach. On the other hand, adaptive learning classification approach reduces the variance in prediction performance in comparison with the corresponding supervised learning algorithm. Conclusion: The adaptive approach outperforms the corresponding supervised learning approach when both use NaiveBayes as base learner. Additional research is needed to investigate whether this observation remains valid with other base classifiers. Copyright © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={In some classification tasks, such as those related to the automatic building and maintenance of text corpora, it is expensive to obtain labeled instances to train a classifier. In such circumstances it is common to have massive corpora where a few instances are labeled (typically a minority) while others are not. Semi-supervised learning techniques try to leverage the intrinsic information in unlabeled instances to improve classification models. However, these techniques assume that the labeled instances cover all the classes to learn which might not be the case. Moreover, when in the presence of an imbalanced class distribution, getting labeled instances from minority classes might be very costly, requiring extensive labeling, if queries are randomly selected. Active learning allows asking an oracle to label new instances, which are selected by criteria, aiming to reduce the labeling effort. D-Confidence is an active learning approach that is effective when in presence of imbalanced training sets. In this paper we evaluate the performance of d-Confidence in comparison to its baseline criteria over tabular and text datasets. We provide empirical evidence that d-Confidence reduces label disclosure complexity-which we have defined as the number of queries required to identify instances from all classes to learn-when in the presence of imbalanced data. © 2012 The Brazilian Computer Society.},

abstract={One difficulty with machine learning for information extraction is the high cost of collecting labeled examples. Active Learning can make more efficient use of the learner's time by asking them to label only instances that are most useful for the trainer. In random sampling approach, unlabeled data is selected for annotation at random and thus can't yield the desired results. In contrast, active learning selects the useful data from a huge pool of unlabeled data for the classifier. The strategies used often classify the corpus tokens (or, data points) into wrong classes. The classifier is confused between two categories if the token is located near the margin. We propose a novel method for solving this problem and show that it favorably results in the increased performance. Our approach is based on the supervised machine learning algorithm, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed approach is applied for solving the problem of named entity recognition (NER) in two Indian languages, namely Hindi and Bengali.

To solve the problem, we introduce active learning method to reduce the amount of training data needed for training a classifier. Moreover, we find premature convergence in active learning algorithms and present an analysis. To prevent premature convergence, we also propose a rank selection based instance query method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is stable and can guarantee high identification accuracy by querying a small quantity of high qualified data.

abstract={In mammograms, masses always vary widely in their shapes and densities, and yet share common appearances with the normal tissues. This point extremely increases the detection difficulty and also impacts the performance of the automatic mass detecting system. To improve the sensitivity of mass detection system, we propose an active learning scheme to detect various masses on mammograms. Firstly, the pairwise constraints are introduced, and the scheme conducts with pairwise support vector machine (PSVM) by involving the relationship among different samples into the classification procedure. Furthermore, according to the detection results, the missed samples with their uncertainty information are combined with the matched feature distance among different samples to provide for re-consideration. Then, with the representative information, the proposed PSVM-based method actively selects the pairwise samples that should be feed back to the training set. The experimental results show that the proposed active learning method with PSVM could make full use of the information of samples, and thus, it could get satisfactory detection rates and false positives during the detection procedure. The method can also get good compromise between the sensitivity and specificity, and the whole learning scheme has better generalization ability and detection performance in comparison with some existing detection methods.},

abstract={Image based human detection is of paramount interest due to its potential applications in fields such as advanced driving assistance, surveillance and media analysis. However, even detecting non-occluded standing humans remains a challenge of intensive research. The most promising human detectors rely on classifiers developed in the discriminative paradigm, i.e. trained with labelled samples. However, labelling is a manual intensive step, especially in cases like human detection where it is necessary to provide at least bounding boxes framing the humans for training. To overcome such problem, some authors have proposed the use of a virtual world where the labels of the different objects are obtained automatically. This means that the human models (classifiers) are learnt using the appearance of rendered images, i.e. using realistic computer graphics. Later, these models are used for human detection in images of the real world. The results of this technique are surprisingly good. However, these are not always as good as the classical approach of training and testing with data coming from the same camera, or similar ones. Accordingly, in this paper we address the challenge of using a virtual world for gathering (while playing a videogame) a large amount of automatically labelled samples (virtual humans and background) and then training a classifier that performs equal, in real-world images, than the one obtained by equally training from manually labelled real-world samples. For doing that, we cast the problem as one of domain adaptation. In doing so, we assume that a small amount of manually labelled samples from real-world images is required. To collect these labelled samples we propose a non-standard active learning technique. Therefore, ultimately our human model is learnt by the combination of virtual and real world labelled samples, which has not been done before. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Active learning has been a popular area of research in recent years. It can be used to improve the performance of learning tasks by asking the labels of unlabeled data from the user. In these methods, the goal is to achieve the highest possible accuracy gain while posing minimum queries to the user. The existing approaches for active learning have been mostly applicable to the traditional binary or multi-class classification problems. However, in many real-world situations, we encounter problems in which we have access only to samples of one class. These problems are known as one-class learning or outlier detection problems and the User relevance feedback in image retrieval systems is an example of such problems. In this paper, we propose an active learning method which uses only samples of one class. We use kernel density estimation as the baseline of one-class learning algorithm and then introduce some confidence criteria to select the best sample to be labeled by the user. The experimental results on real world and artificial datasets show that in the proposed method, the average gain in accuracy is increased significantly, compared to the popular random unlabeled sample selection strategy. © 2011 IEEE.},

Generally, there are two ways to select constrained information, one is random selection method and the other is active learning method. Here we focus on active learning methods. In this paper, we propose an active learning process, which considers the local and global information of dataset, and decide which constraint to choose by studying the change of eigenvectors. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose and study a new intelligent teaching paradigm called active teaching in this paper. In contrast to active learning, we assume that the learner can only passively conduct inductive learning from the given examples, but the teacher (oracle) can actively provide "good" examples to the learner, in order to speed up the teaching (learning) process. We establish the framework with four specific paradigms of active teaching, and develop the corresponding teaching strategies. Empirical study shows that, the proposed teaching strategies can indeed outperform the traditional active learning and the basic random sampling strategies, thus making the teaching (learning) process more efficient.

abstract={Active learning is an important method for solving data scarcity problem in machine learning, and most research work of active learning are pool-based. However, this type of active learning is easily affected by pool size, and makes performance improvement of classifier slow. A novel active learning with constructing queries based pool is proposed. Each iteration the training process first chooses representative instance from pool predefined, then employs climbing algorithm to construct instance to label which best represents the original unlabeled set. It makes each queried instance more representative than any instance in the pool. Compared with the original pool based method and a state-of-the-art active learning with constructing queries directly, the new method makes the prediction error rate of classifier drop more fast, and improves the performance of active learning classifier. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) extraction from biomedicine literature can supply the biomedicine researcher with useful information rapidly. This paper presents a PPI extraction system based on the ensemble kernel model and active learning. Firstly, the ensemble kernel within SVM classifier combines the lexical feature-based kernel and the path-based kernel. Experimental results show that the F-score of PPI extraction using ensemble kernel model on AIMED, IEPA and BCPPI corpora are 64.50%, 69.74% and 60.38% respectively with 10-fold cross-validation, which are better than the lexical feature-based kernel and the path-based kernel separately. As the above ensemble kernel model based on SVM needs large labeled data and it is expensive to label data manually, we integrate active learning into the ensemble kernel model. The active learning method uses the uncertainty-based sampling strategy. The experimental results integrating the active learning show that the F-score on AIMED, IEPA and BCPPI corpora are 65.24%, 70.19% and 61.87% respectively, which are better than those using the ensemble kernel model with the passive learning, and meantime reduce the labeling data by 20%, 30% and 30%, respectively. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Recommender systems help Web users to address information overload. Their performance, however, depends on the amount of information that users provide about their preferences. Users are not willing to provide information for a large amount of items, thus the quality of recommendations is affected specially for new users. Active learning has been proposed in the past, to acquire preference information from users. Based on an underlying prediction model, these approaches determine the most informative item for querying the new user to provide a rating. In this paper, we propose a new active learning method which is developed specially based on aspect model features. There is a difference between classic active learning and active learning for recommender system. In the recommender system context, each item has already been rated by training users while in classic active learning there is not training user. We take into account this difference and develop a new method which competes with a complicated bayesian approach in accuracy while results in drastically reduced (one order of magnitude) user waiting times, i.e., the time that the users wait before being asked a new query. © 2011 IEEE.},

Compound classification is a supervised technique that requires a suitable multitemporal training set for modeling the temporal correlation between multitemporal images. The temporal correlation is represented by the prior joint probabilities of classes which allow one to obtain accurate land-cover transitions maps. However, the collection of labeled samples is time consuming as well as costly. In this paper, a novel active learning method based on joint entropy is proposed to properly increase the number of initial multitemporal training samples by taking into account the temporal correlation between multitemporal images.

abstract={Thanks to large-scale image repositories, vast amounts of data for object recognition are now easily available. However, acquiring training labels for arbitrary objects still requires tedious and expensive human effort. This is particularly true for localization, where humans must not only provide labels, but also training windows in an image. We present an approach for reducing die number of labelled training instances required to train an object classifier and for assisting the user in specifying optimal object location windows. As part of this process, the algorithm performs localization to find bounding windows for training examples that are best aligned with the current classification function, which optimizes learning and reduces human effort. To test this approach, we introduce an active learning extension to a latent SVM learning algorithm. Our user interface for training object detectors employs real-time interaction with a human user. Our active learning system provides a mean performance improvement of 4.5% in the average precision over a state of the art detector on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2007 with an average of just 40 minutes of human labelling effort per class.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel human activity recognition approach that only requires a single video example per activity. We introduce the paradigm of active video composition, which enables one-example recognition of complex activities. The idea is to automatically create a large number of semi-artificial training videos called composed videos by manipulating an original human activity video. A methodology to automatically compose activity videos having different backgrounds, translations, scales, actors, and movement structures is described in this paper. Furthermore, an active learning algorithm to model the temporal structure of the human activity has been designed, preventing the generation of composed training videos violating the structural constraints of the activity. The intention is to generate composed videos having correct organizations, and take advantage of them for the training of the recognition system. In contrast to previous passive recognition systems relying only on given training videos, our methodology actively composes necessary training videos that the system is expected to observe in its environment. Experimental results illustrate that a single fully labeled video per activity is sufficient for our methodology to reliably recognize human activities by utilizing composed training videos. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent research in multi-robot exploration and mapping has focused on sampling environmental fields, which are typically modeled using the Gaussian process (GP). Existing information-theoretic exploration strategies for learning GP-based environmental field maps adopt the non-Markovian problem structure and consequently scale poorly with the length of history of observations. Hence, it becomes computationally impractical to use these strategies for in situ, realtime active sampling. To ease this computational burden, this paper presents a Markov-based approach to efficient information-theoretic path planning for active sampling of GP-based fields. We analyze the time complexity of solving the Markov-based path planning problem, and demonstrate analytically that it scales better than that of deriving the non-Markovian strategies with increasing length of planning horizon. For a class of exploration tasks called the transect sampling task, we provide theoretical guarantees on the active sampling performance of our Markov-based policy, from which ideal environmental field conditions and sampling task settings can be established to limit its performance degradation due to violation of the Markov assumption. Empirical evaluation on real-world temperature and plankton density field data shows that our Markov-based policy can generally achieve active sampling performance comparable to that of the widely-used non-Markovian greedy policies under less favorable realistic field conditions and task settings while enjoying significant computational gain over them.
